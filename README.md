# Software 2.0 Sketch

What Would a Software 2.0 Programming Language Look Like?

## Setup

```bash
$ virtualenv .venv
$ source .venv/bin/activate
```

## What is this Project?

`software20` aims to provide a sketch of what a
["software 2.0"](https://blog.nodejs.dk/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/software-2-0-a64152b37c35)
programming language would look and feel like.

### Software 1.0

In a nutshell, "software 1.0" involves the type of programming we all know and
love: you have a problem whose solution can be framed as some set of
instructions that take input and produce an output, and the programmer goes
about explicitly writing down the instructions.

```mermaid
flowchart TB;
    subgraph problem domain
    X([input]) --> P[program]
    P --> B([output])
    end
    H[programmer 1.0] -. writes .-> P
```

### Software 2.0

In "software 2.0", on the other hand, programming takes on a different flavor.
Instead of explicitly writing instructions, the programmer structures data
which constrains an optimization routine that finds the program for us.

```mermaid
flowchart TB;
    subgraph dataset [training data]
    train_input([train input])
    train_output([train output])
    end

    subgraph real-world data
    X([test input]) --> P[program]
    P --> Y([test output])
    end

    H1[programmer 1.0] -. writes .-> O[optimizer]
    H2[programmer 2.0] -. structures .-> dataset
    dataset --constrains--> O
    O -. writes .-> P
```


## `software20`: what would software 2.0 look like?

### Inspiration: ML models ðŸ¤– are "just" function approximators

Just as software 1.0 compiles the instructions that a programmer writes into
machine code, software 2.0 compiles data that has been structured by a programmer
into model "code" (e.g. weights in a neural net).

### What's in a Name?

It's hard to name things, but here are some alternatives to the "1.0", "2.0"
nomenclature:

| Software 1.0 | Software 2.0  |
--- | ---
| Instruction-oriented Programming | Optimization-oriented Programming |
| Deductive Programming | Inductive Programming |
| Explicit Programming | Intuitive Programming |

## Feature ðŸ§ â›ˆ

- multilayered API for software 1.0 programmer
  - easy to specify interface of the function
  - abstract away the model search problem (i.e. AutoML)
  - ability to customize internal architecture and optimization function.
  - provide visibility and metrics into the optimization process
- active learning interface for software 2.0 programmer
  - provide minimal data labelling interfaces for different function types
  - provide utilities for auto-labelling, data augmentation, and model
    debugging (think [snorkel](https://www.snorkel.org/))
  - automatic handling of serialization of data annotations (data as code)
  - facilitate feedback-loop for model re-training
